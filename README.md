# Life-Range

Life-Range enables you to explore factors that influence longevity through the metaphors of a Lifeclock and a Biometer.

The Lifeclock maps your life span from birth to estimated death on a 12-hour clock. The time the clock is set to represents the your current age in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds. 

The Biometer maps your chronological and biological age to a speedometer. If the two hands of the biometer converge your chronological and biological ages are the same. If these hands diverge then you may feel old or younger than calendar says.

Life-Range incorporates longevity factors into the estimation of a your life span. These factors include activity level, stress level, risk behavior level, and quality of your genetics. Life-Range lets you self-score these factors on a scale from 1 to 10. You can see instantly the effect of increasing or decreasing your activity, stress, and risk behaviors on the length of your life. There's not much you can do about your genetics (although this my change soon) but you can choose to change your lifestyle to improve your chances.

Life-Range is a fun app that uses a "toy model" and metaphors with some attempt to use current health and longevity research to show how your lifestyle choices may delay, or hasten, the inevitable.

Life-Range is an app for inspirational, entertainment, and educational purposesâ€”it does not in any way predict the actual length of your life.
